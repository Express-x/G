### Documentation for Planner and Developer Agents

---

#### 1. Dashboard Task Management (Planner Agent)

**Feature:** Append tasks to the dashboard database for the developer agent to implement.

**Request Structure:**
```json
{
  "dashboard_of_plans": "append tasks to dashboard for the developer to implement"
}
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **Parameters:**
  - `dashboard_of_plans`: String containing task details to be appended to the dashboard database.
  
- **Functionality:**
  - **Append Task:** The planner agent can append new tasks to the **task queue** (dashboard database) without interrupting the developer agent’s ongoing work.
  - **Concurrency:** The task append operation is concurrent-safe, ensuring the planner agent can add tasks while the developer agent processes them.
  - **Logging:** Each task appended is logged with a timestamp and task ID.
  - **Response:** Return a confirmation message after successfully adding the task to the dashboard database.

---

#### 2. Task Queue Management for the Developer Agent

**Feature:** Automatically assign tasks from the dashboard database (task queue) to the developer agent, one task at a time.

**Implementation Flow:**
1. **Task Retrieval from Dashboard Database:**
   - The developer agent checks the task queue (dashboard database) for pending tasks.
   - **If a task is available:**
     - It fetches the first available task (FIFO order).
     - Marks the task as **"in-progress"** in the dashboard database to prevent duplicate processing.
   - **If no tasks are available:**
     - The developer agent waits for a new task to be added.

2. **Task Completion:**
   - Once the developer agent completes the current task, it marks the task as **"complete"** in the dashboard database.
   - Fetches and starts the next task in the queue automatically.
   - If no tasks are pending, the developer agent waits for a new task.

**Concurrency Handling:**
- The system ensures that tasks are processed sequentially by the developer agent and allows simultaneous task appending by the planner agent.

---

#### 3. Task Completion Documentation (Developer Agent)

**Feature:** Document task completion and trigger the next task assignment.

**Request Structure:**
```json
{
  "task_completion": "task completion documentation"
}
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **Parameters:**
  - `task_completion`: String containing details about the completed task.
  
- **Functionality:**
  - **Mark Task as Complete:** The developer agent marks the task as completed in the dashboard database.
  - **Log Completion:** The task completion is logged with a timestamp, task ID, and status ("complete").
  - **Next Task Assignment:** Upon task completion, the developer agent automatically fetches and starts the next task from the task queue.
  - **Response:** A confirmation message is returned, indicating the task has been completed and the next task is being processed.

---

#### 4. File Creation and Writing (Developer Agent)

**Feature:** Create a new file and write initial code.

**Request Structure:**
```json
{
  "create_and_write": "file_name_here",
  "action": "initial",
  "append_code": "code to append to file on first time creation"
}
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **Parameters:**
  - `create_and_write`: String indicating the name of the file to be created.
  - `action`: Fixed value "initial" indicating that this is the first time the file is being created.
  - `append_code`: String containing the code to write to the new file.
  
- **Functionality:**
  - **Check File Existence:** Verify if the file exists. If not, create it and write the `append_code`.
  - **Concurrency Consideration:** Files can be created simultaneously by different developer agents without conflict.
  - **Response:** A success message is returned, confirming the file has been created.

---

#### 5. Refactoring Code (Developer Agent)

**Feature:** Refactor existing code in a specified file.

**Request Structure:**
```json
{
  "create_and_write": "file_name_here",
  "action": "refactor",
  "target_code": "old code to be replaced",
  "append_code": "code to append to file as refactored optimized code"
}
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **Parameters:**
  - `create_and_write`: String indicating the name of the file containing the code to be refactored.
  - `action`: Fixed value "refactor" indicating a code refactoring operation.
  - `target_code`: String specifying the old code to be replaced.
  - `append_code`: String containing the new code to replace the `target_code`.
  
- **Functionality:**
  - **Locate Target Code:** Open the file, locate the `target_code`, and replace it with the `append_code`.
  - **Response:** Return a confirmation message, indicating the code has been refactored and saved.

---

#### 6. Adding New Features (Developer Agent)

**Feature:** Append new features to existing code.

**Request Structure:**
```json
{
  "create_and_write": "file_name_here",
  "action": "new_feature",
  "target_code": "code after which the append should be placed",
  "append_code": "new feature code to append to existing codes in file"
}
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **Parameters:**
  - `create_and_write`: String indicating the name of the file where the new feature will be appended.
  - `action`: Fixed value "new_feature" indicating the addition of new functionality.
  - `target_code`: String indicating the code after which the new feature will be appended.
  - `append_code`: String containing the new feature code to be added.
  
- **Functionality:**
  - **Locate Target Code:** Open the file and find the `target_code`.
  - **Append New Feature:** Append the `append_code` after the `target_code`.
  - **Response:** Return a success message confirming the new feature has been added.

---

#### 7. User Clarification Queries (Planner Agent)

**Feature:** Ask the user for clarification on tasks.

**Request Structure:**
```json
{
  "question_user": "ask user for clarification of tasks"
}
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **Parameters:**
  - `question_user`: String containing the question or request for clarification.
  
- **Functionality:**
  - **Prompt User:** The **planner agent** sends a question to the user for clarification.
  - **Capture User Response:** The system captures the user's response and processes it for further planning or task refinement.
  - **Response:** Return a message indicating the question has been posed to the user, and the planner will proceed based on the clarification.

### Key Considerations for Concurrent Task Processing

1. **Task Queue (Dashboard Database):**
   - The task queue operates as a **FIFO** (First-In, First-Out) system.
   - The developer agent processes tasks one at a time, marked as "in-progress" during execution to avoid duplication.
   - The planner agent can continuously append new tasks to the queue without interrupting the developer’s work.

2. **Concurrency Handling:**
   - Use **locks** or **transactions** to prevent race conditions when multiple agents (planner and developer) access or modify the dashboard database.
   - Ensure tasks marked as "in-progress" are locked for the developer agent until completion.

3. **Task Status Updates:**
   - Tasks in the dashboard database should have clear statuses (e.g., **pending**, **in-progress**, **complete**) for efficient task management.

4. **Asynchronous Task Management:**
   - **Event-driven system** or **polling** can be implemented to notify the developer agent when new tasks are appended to the dashboard by the planner agent.
  
5. **Separation of Responsibilities:**
   - The **planner agent** handles task planning, user clarifications, and dashboard management.
   - The **developer agent** focuses solely on task execution, file management, and task completion logging.

With these adjustments, the **planner agent** can continue appending tasks and requesting clarifications from the user while the **developer agent** processes tasks from the dashboard, one at a time.
