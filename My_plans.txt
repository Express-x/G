### Snake Game Design Plan

* **Game Overview**
  • The game will be a simple implementation of the classic Snake game.
  • The game will be played on a rectangular grid.
  • The player will control a snake that can move up, down, left, or right.
  • The objective of the game is to eat food pellets and avoid colliding with the wall or the snake's own body.

* **Game Features**
  • The game will have a score system that increments each time the snake eats a food pellet.
  • The game will have a level system that increases the difficulty as the player progresses.
  • The game will have a high score system that stores the player's highest score.

* **Game Mechanics**
  • The snake will move in a direction based on user input.
  • The snake will eat food pellets and grow in length.
  • The snake will collide with the wall or its own body and end the game.

* **Implementation Plan**
  • Create a game loop that updates the game state and renders the game.
  • Implement user input handling to control the snake's movement.
  • Implement collision detection to check for collisions with the wall or the snake's own body.
  • Implement scoring and level systems.

* **Next Steps**
  • Implement the game loop and user input handling.
  • Implement collision detection and scoring systems.
  • Test and refine the game.
